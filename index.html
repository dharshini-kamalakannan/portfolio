    <h2>Project</h2>
    <h3>1. Indian Sign Language Detection using Deep Learning</h3>
    <p>Developed an Indian Sign Language (ISL) detection system to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text. The system uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to process real-time video input. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and others by enabling gesture-based interaction.
 <br>
<strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, CNN, NumPy,NLP.
